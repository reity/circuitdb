class circuitdb(dict):
    """
    Wrapper class for a circuit data set that contains an (arbitrary but fixed)
    example of the smallest possible logical circuit (in terms of the number of
    unary and/or binary gates) for each possible logical function (from a finite
    set of functions). This class supports both a dictionary-like interface
    (inherited from the ``dict`` type) and a function-like interface (via the
    :obj:`__call__` method).

    **Logical Function Representation:** Logical functions are represented using
    tuples, as in the `logical <https://pypi.org/project/logical/>`_ library. For
    example, the logical function *f* (*x*, *y*, *z*) = *x* **and** *y* **and** *z*
    (*i.e.*, three-argument conjunction) is represented using a tuple representation
    of the output column of the truth table for the function (assuming that the
    possible inputs are in ascending dictionary order): ``(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1)``.

    >>> circuitdb((0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1))
    [((0, 1),), ((0, 1),), ((0, 1),), ((0, 0, 0, 1), 0, 1), ((0, 0, 0, 1), 2, 3), ((0, 1), 4)]

    For logical functions having multiple outputs, the entries in the tuple may
    themselves be tuples. For example, *f* (*x*, *y*) = (*y*, *x*) is represented
    using the tuple ``((0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1))``.

    >>> circuitdb(((0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)))
    [0, 1, ((0, 1), 1), ((0, 1), 0)]

    **Circuit Representation:** The representation of a circuit consists of a list
    of unary and binary gates. Each gate is represented as a tuple. The first entry
    in each gate tuple is the logical function corresponding to that gate (represented
    as in the `logical <https://pypi.org/project/logical/>`_ library). The remaining
    entries in the gate tuple are the indices of the input gates to that gate.

    >>> circuitdb((0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1))
    [((0, 1),), ((0, 1),), ((0, 1),), ((0, 0, 0, 1), 0, 1), ((0, 0, 0, 1), 2, 3), ((0, 1), 4)]

    In the circuit above, the entry ``((0, 0, 0, 1), 2, 3)`` represents a gate that
    is a conjunction (*i.e.*, ``(0, 0, 0, 1)``) of the gates at positions ``2`` and
    ``3`` in the overall list (*i.e.* , ``((0, 1),)`` and ``((0, 0, 0, 1), 0, 1)``).

    **Gate Sets:** For any given logical function, it is possible to construct a
    corresponding circuit using a variety of gate sets. For each logical function,
    the database contains an example of a smallest circuit for each of a small
    collection of sets of unary and binary gates. In the remaining examples below,
    circuits for the function ``(0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1)`` are retrieved. The unary
    and binary logical operators represented by the gates in the circuit below are
    found in the set of ``{logical.id_, logical.not_, logical.and_, logical.or_}``.

    >>> from logical import logical
    >>> circuitdb((0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1), frozenset([logical.id_, logical.not_, logical.and_, logical.or_]))
    [((0, 1),), ((0, 1),), ((0, 1),), ((0, 0, 0, 1), 0, 2), ((0, 1, 1, 1), 0, 2), ((1, 0), 4), ((0, 1, 1, 1), 3, 5), ((0, 0, 0, 1), 1, 6), ((0, 1), 7)]

    All gates in the circuit below are found in the set
    ``{logical.id_, logical.not_, logical.and_, logical.xor_}``.

    >>> circuitdb((0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1), frozenset([logical.id_, logical.not_, logical.and_, logical.xor_]))
    [((0, 1),), ((0, 1),), ((0, 1),), ((1, 0), 0), ((0, 1, 1, 0), 2, 3), ((0, 0, 0, 1), 1, 4), ((0, 1), 5)]

    By default (or if the set of all gates ``logical.every`` is specified), a smallest circuit that can be built using *any* combination of unary or binary gates is returned.

    >>> circuitdb((0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1))
    [((0, 1),), ((0, 1),), ((0, 1),), ((0, 1, 1, 0), 0, 2), ((0, 0, 1, 0), 1, 3), ((0, 1), 4)]

    **Supported Combinations:** Each logical function has a number of input values,
    a number of output values, and gates drawn from a specific gate set. Entries
    exist in the database for only a finite set of logical functions. The table
    below lists the supported combinations of function input count, function output
    count, and gate set that are found in the database. **All** functions for a given
    combination of inputs and outputs are supported (*e.g.*, all ``2**(2**3) = 256``
    functions having three inputs and one output are supported). Gate sets are defined
    in the `logical <https://pypi.org/project/logical/>`_ library).

    The database supports retrieval using index notation, as well.

    The top-level database instance has keys that represent to the number of
    inputs of the logical function. The second level down, the keys represent
    the number of outputs of a logical function. The third level down, keys
    represent the set of unary or binary gates to which circuits are restricted.
    Finally, the last level down, the keys represent logical functions.

        Function-like interface for the circuit database, with user-friendly
        defaults for retrieving circuit data.

        By supplying a logical function (represented as a tuple), it is possible
        to retrieve a smallest circuit that implements that function. Logical
        functions having one output are represented using a tuple of
        integers (or booleans), or a tuple of one-element tuples.

        A logical function having a vector of two outputs is represented using
        a tuple of two-element tuples.

        It is also possible to retrieve a smallest circuit that only uses gates
        from a specific set of gates.
